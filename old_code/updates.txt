DONE:

1. found bug with our previous string->hex functions. 
    - there was truncation going on when ids or labels had leading 0s.
    - replaced with bitstring2bytes() function.

2. organized header, question, and answer objects for writing/processing purposes
    - saves us having to process questions.
    - makes dumping fields easier.
    - rewrote main script to go along w/ these changes

did all of these changes in header.py. can replace code in dns.py if you'd like.

TD:

1. fill out Answer class, specifically process_response()
    - not sure how large the name domain is... everything else is pretty clear.
    - Answer class should contain list of resource records.

2. show entire pipeline working for a few different domains.
    - gmu.edu, google.com, etc.

3. test more thoroughly--many different sites run many times (100x?)

4. change formatting, add necessary files like Partner.txt or whatever the instructions say.
